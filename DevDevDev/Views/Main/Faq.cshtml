            <strong>When and where?</strong><br />
            We're going to be held on the 28th May 2016 but we are still in the process of finalising the where, but it will be at one of the inner-city University locations..
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>How much is the event?</strong><br />
            $49. DDD Sydney is a non profit event and any excess will be kept as part of a fund for future events/donated to charity.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Will refreshments be provided?</strong><br />
            Yes, delegates will receive lunch and snacks throughout the day. Sadly we are restricted from running a coffee cart by the
            university but there are many cafes and coffee shops in the local area & on campus.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Will wireless access be available?</strong><br />
            Probably not.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Can I pay by cheque, invoice, cash, Coinye West?</strong><br />
            No - this year all payments will be via EventBrite. It's vastly easier for us as organisers to only accept payments using EventBrite, which currently doesn't allow payments to be made by Diners or rapper themed bitcoins.
            Please consider using EventBrite with your own credit card, and claiming it back on expenses.
            The cost is low, so it should easily fall within your expenses limit!
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Can I cancel/give my ticket to someone else?</strong><br />
            You are welcome to send someone else in your place. Please do this through the Eventbrite system.
            For help on how to do this refer to: <a href="http://help.eventbrite.com/customer/en_us/portal/articles/430100-change-the-info-on-your-order-or-ticket">http://help.eventbrite.com/customer/en_us/portal/articles/430100-change-the-info-on-your-order-or-ticket</a>

            Great! DDD Sydney will be heavily publized in related websites and we believe
            offers a fantastic marketing opportunity as well as the ability to support the local development
            community. We have various levels of sponsor ship available and opportunities for
            logo placement on the website, agenda, delegate slides, speaker tshirts and we are
            happy to include advertisements in delegate packs. For more information please email
